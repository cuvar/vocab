# Getting started

## Prerequisites

In order for this app to work, you need to have a relational database running.
The app is built and tested on PostgreSQL, but it should work with other relational databases as well.
I'm using a database hosted at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) for my own instance of the app. But you can really use any other database provider as well.

### Seeding the database

## Deployment

Currently, there are two ways to deploy this application:

1. Deploy it on your own server (manually)
2. Deploy it with Vercel

In the future, I plan to add more deployment options, but feel free to create a pull request if you want to add another deployment option.

### 1. Deploy it on your own server (manually)

You can deploy this application on your own server.
Just clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cuvar/vocab &&
npm install &&
npm run build &&
npm start
```

However, don't forget the [`.env` file](#environment-variables).

### 2. Deploying with Vercel

Just click the button below to deploy the app with Vercel. Be sure to fill in the environment variables as stated in the [`.env` file](#environment-variables).

### Environment variables

No matter how you want to deploy this application, you need to specify the environment variables as stated in the `.env.example` file.
The easiest way to do this is to create a `.env` file in the root of the project and fill in the values. An example `.env` file could look like this:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="https://your-super-cool-database-url.com/postgres"
NEXTAUTH_URL="https://yourdomain.com"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="zXi5xYQU12qLk1dxA7WSaR5pYIhqKig2c4OsBduVCC0="
USERNAME="admin"
PASSWORD="extremlySecretPassword"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FRONT_ICON="üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å•Û†ÅÆÛ†ÅßÛ†Åø"
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACK_ICON="üá©üá™"
```

The `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` can be generated with the following command:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```
